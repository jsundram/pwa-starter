// Usage-ping endpoint. Pairs with ping.js and the /usage/ dashboard. Lives in the repo for
// reference only — the LIVE copy runs as an Apps Script *bound to the analytics sheet*
// (Extensions -> Apps Script from the sheet), so there's no sheet id to configure and =UID()
// works as a spreadsheet formula.
//
// One-time setup (in your Google account):
//   1. sheets.new -> name it "APP analytics". Keep it PRIVATE (never share / link-view).
//      Row 1 headers: received | opened | page | who
//   2. Extensions -> Apps Script -> replace the stub with this file -> Save.
//   3. Deploy -> New deployment -> Web app -> Execute as: Me -> Who has access: Anyone -> authorize.
//      ("Anyone" = anyone can APPEND a ping; only you can OPEN the sheet.)
//   4. Copy the /exec URL into URL_ in ping.js, commit, bump sw.js V.
//   5. Format the `who` column as Plain text (Format -> Number -> Plain text) so all-digit uids
//      aren't silently coerced to numbers (breaks the =UID() reverse lookup for ~2% of names).
//   6. Verify: open  .../exec?k=<token>&p=test&u=  -> "ok" + a row appears. Delete the test row.
//   7. For the /usage/ dashboard: File -> Share -> Publish to web -> the pings TAB only, as CSV.
//      Paste that CSV URL into PINGS_CSV in usage/index.html. Keep the sheet itself private.
//
// After editing this later: Deploy -> Manage deployments -> pencil -> Version: New -> Deploy.
// A PLAIN SAVE DOES NOT UPDATE THE LIVE /exec URL. (Custom functions like UID() do update on save.)
//
// Keep doGet tolerant of missing params forever: old clients flush queued pings shaped by old code.

const TOK = "app-token";   // must match TOK in ping.js

function doGet(e){
  const p = (e && e.parameter) || {};

// =UID(name) in the sheet -> the ping.js uid for that name. Array-aware: =UID(A2:A) fills a whole
// key column in one call. Must match ping.js EXACTLY: SHA-256 over UTF-8, first 4 bytes, lc hex.
// Reverse names in-sheet: a `key` tab with names in A + =UID(A2:A) in B, then VLOOKUP the who col.
function UID(name){
  if (Array.isArray(name)) return name.map(UID);
